# Neunity

## The Purpose

One of the most outstanding challenge of developing NEO Dapps/Smart Contract(SC) is the blockchain interaction. To test/debug the SC we have to face the following challenges, comparing with the conventional app development:

* **Chain Setup**: We need to setup a private chain or apply for some GAS from testnet, which sometimes kills hours. [neocompiler.io](neocompiler.io) is the best acceleration we found so far, with execellent development experience and the whole gamut of tools. [privatenet docker image](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-privatenet-docker) is another smart choice if you have to work offline (in subway or on airplane, a cafÃ© with phishing WIFI). Another advantage of local privatenet is that you would never worry about your hands frozen during winter - Well, I'm in Canada and I guarantee it.
* **Deployment**: To test even a tiny value change, you have to re-deploy the smart contract. If the wallet is lack of GAS, we need to wait for a few blocks for GAS claiming even we are the richest in the world. Then we wait another couple of blocks for SC deployment. 
* **Logging/Debug**: No breakpoint, no step in, The only thing we lean on is `Runtime.Notify` supporting only byte array (Not sure `Runtime.Log`, I didn't try it). Then we do the type conversion to understand the symptom, feeling like some sort of encrypted telegram from a spy.
* **Logic Feature Restrictions**: NEO smart contract does not support all .Net framework syntax, frameworks, or language features (type conversion, byte munipulation, class method declaration, etc.). It causes runtime confusion since the compiler doesn't complain all of them. eg. a [Ternary issue](https://github.com/NeoResearch/learning-examples/blob/master/BadExamples.md) which blocked my friend's project a few days.



Through the team [Norchain](http://norchain.io/home/)'s experience during the [NEO Game Competition](http://neo.game/), we are trying to alleviate the above pains for C# Dapps. The essential ideas are:

1. During Development/Debug period, embed the SC code (by C#) into client, and invoke them via a mock RPC call. So we can direct put breakpoints into SC and debug them chainlessly. 
2. During Test/Deployment period, change a few references in the SC and client code (without logic change), then both can work in a chain powered envrionment.
3. Avoid the SC logic from using any restricted logic features as much as possible.

We'll talk about how to realise them in the following section.



## The Structure

The C# applications may have various restrictions of .Net framework adaption. In this section, we'll take the world's famous game engine Unity for example, since we already implemented this part and tested working well with Norchain's game [CarryBattle](http://norchain.io/home/carrybattle.html). 

In order to realize the targets mentioned at the end of the previous section, let's consider a three layer structure demostrated in the following figure.

### Application Layer

This is the top layer of the whole Dapp, also the only layer that requires the developer's implementation in Neunity's structure. Application layer logic is divided into two categories:

1. **Offchain Logic**: Any logic that developers would't put into SC. eg. The UI, ViewController, etc.
2. **Contract Logic**: The SC logic, including the assert managment, public algorithms, etc. 

With Neunity's structure, contract logic is shared between SC and client. 

Let's check out the following example `CardGameSC.cs`: 

```csharp
/** SampleCode: A Neunity powered NEO Smart Contract
Check ./Neunity/Samples/SampleUnity/Assets/Scripts/CardGameSC.cs for the complete implementation of this class.
*/
using System;
using System.Numerics;
using Neunity.Adapters.Unity;	//Uncomment this line to use this class in Client
//using Neunity.Adapters.NEO;	//Uncomment this line to use this class in SC
using Neunity.Tools;

namespace Neunity.SomeCardGame
{
    public class CardGame : SmartContract
    {
        //... Some Previous logic
        
        // The definition of class Card
        public class Card
        {
            public BigInteger type;   
            public byte[] lvls;
            public BigInteger score;
            public string name;
            // --- Non-Storage fields ---
            public BigInteger age;    //We don't plan to put it in blockchain storage
        }
        
		public static BigInteger UpdateAge(Card card){
			card.age = Blockchain.GetHeight() - card.birthBlock;
			return card.age;
		}
		// Customized Serialization for Card.
		// The Class Neunity.Tools.SD Manages Serialization/Deserialization.
        public static byte[] Card2Bytes(Card card) => SD.JoinSegs2Seg(
            SD.SegInt(card.type),
            SD.Seg(card.lvls),
            SD.SegInt(card.score),
            SD.SegString(card.name)
        );

        // Customized Deserialization for Card
        // The class Neunity.Adapter.Op manages type conversation for different platforms 
        public static Card Bytes2Card(byte[] data) => new Card
        {
            type = Op.Bytes2BigInt(SD.DesegWithIdFromSeg(data,0) ),
            lvls = SD.DesegWithIdFromSeg(data,1),
            score = Op.Bytes2BigInt(SD.DesegWithIdFromSeg(data,2) ),
            name = Op.Bytes2String(SD.DesegWithIdFromSeg(data,3) )
        };

        // The Logic of merging two cards
        public static Byte[] CardMerge(byte[] cardData1, byte[] cardData2, string name)
        {
            Card card1 = Bytes2Card(cardData1);
            Card card2 = Bytes2Card(cardData2);
            Card card = new Card{
            	type = card1.type,
            	lvls = card2.lvls,
            	name = name,
            	birthBlock = Blockchain.GetHeight()
            };
            byte[] newCardData = Card2Bytes(card);
            
            //Neunity.Tools.IO manages the interaction of storage for different platforms.
            IO.SetStorageWithKeyPath(newCardData, "card/", name);
            return newCardData;
        }

        //Main Entrance
        public static Object Main(string operation, params object[] args)
        {
            if (operation == "cardMerge")
            {
                byte[] cardData1 = (byte[])args[0];
                byte[] cardData2 = (byte[])args[1];
                string name = (string)args[2];

                return CardMerge(cardData1,cardData2,name);
            }
            if (operation == "getCard")
            {   //Used Internally Only
                byte[] cardData = (byte[])args[0];
                return Bytes2Card(cardData);
            }
            //... Other operations
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

`CardGameSC.cs` is put directly in Unity, 



```cs
/**The client code run in Unity*/
using Neunity.SmartContract;
public class TestSC{
    public MergeTwoCards(Card c1, Card c2){
        object[] args = new object[2];
        
    }
}
```



Combining *SampleCode1* with the file `./Neunity/Adapters/NEO.cs` and all classes in  `./Neunity/Tools` , 

In the above snippet, we have the definition of the class `Card` along with related operations. These logic can be used in SC. It can also be used on Unity side to make the preview of the merge result before invoking the contract.

It's recommended that the developers to seperate the offchain, contract and shared logic into different files while developing/debuging, while put the contract and shared logic as parts of SC during
